\section{Beyond secret sharing}

Congratulations on making it through this packet! You have not only 
learned about secret sharing, a building block for many other cryptographic 
primitives that are used in the real world\footnotemark, but have also
gotten a glimpse into what modern cryptography research looks like. 
The same definitions and proof techniques you saw in this packet pop 
up in many other areas of cryptography, and you now have a head start in 
understanding the techniques in many other subfields.

\footnotetext{Most notably, secret sharing forms the basis of many 
\emph{multiparty computation (MPC)} schemes. These allow multiple 
parties, as the name implies, to compute functions over their secret 
inputs. For example, the Boston Womenâ€™s Workforce Council organized 
an effort which used MPC\cite[page 12]{bwwc} to calculate statistics 
about the salaries of the workforce in about 16\% of the Boston area to 
show that the gender pay gap was wider than what the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported\cite{bwwc}. MPC was necessary because companies needed 
to keep their data on employee salaries secret due to privacy concerns.}
