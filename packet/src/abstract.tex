\indent In this problem set, you will learn how to use math to share a secret among a group of people so that they have to work together to learn the secret. This is the cryptographic technique known as \emph{secret sharing} and is the basis for many useful tools being deployed in the world today.

Before we get started, a quick note about reading mathematical texts: it is very normal when reading math to read a passage or even a single sentence several times before understanding it properly. Also, never trust the author! Check every claim and calculation (time permitting). Take your time and never give up. Let's talk math!
